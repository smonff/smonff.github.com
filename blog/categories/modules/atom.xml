    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, programming languages have so much big standard libraries that it's a pain to know everything: one of my programming teacher (a C and C++ addict) told me that the thing that hurts him with Java and .Net was the huge standard library and the difficulty of having a good knowledge of these <em>toolkits</em>. Maybe he was not wrong, and that documentation is sometimes a kind of unusable garbage, or even disappearing (for example when Oracle moved everything about Java to random locations).</p>

<p>However, it can be a bigger pain to re-write something that already exists than to learn and build easy tools to search for informations inside your standard library. A tool that allow to search for common modules names (like <em>URI</em> manipulation or <em>JSON</em> or <em>IO</em>, anything), it's sometime too long to search on metacpan.org and on perl.org when you just need to <code>use</code> something in your code. This problem comes also from my bad (human) memory, I can't remember all these tools that I used only a few times. I can even less remember oneliners whith more than 20 chars...</p>

<!--more-->


<p>``` perl
perl -MExtUtils::Installed -MData::Dumper -e  'my ($inst) = ExtUtils::Installed->new(); print Dumper($inst->modules());'
````
... is maybe a possible solution to search for modules, but it is hard to remember.</p>

<p>I wondered how I could display all the modules installed on my machine (most of the time, you don't need a <em>new</em> module). So after a search, <a href="stackoverflow.com/questions/115425/how-do-i-get-a-list-of-installed-cpan-modules#answer-117386">I found something that makes possible to display all the modules on my machine</a> (standard or user-installed modules, AKA <code>@INC</code> content).</p>

<p>The only thing that were missing was a kind of searchability. As I was too lazy and shy to try to extend <code>App::Module::Lister</code>, I've just wrote some configuration in my <code>.bashrc</code>.</p>

<p>First install App::Module::Lister...</p>

<p><code>bash
$ cpanm App::Module::Lister
Searching App::Module::Lister on cpanmetadb ...
Fetching http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/B/BD/BDFOY/App-Module-Lister-0.15.tar.gz
Building and testing App-Module-Lister-0.15
All tests successful.
Successfully installed App-Module-Lister-0.15
1 distribution installed
</code></p>

<p>...then in .bashrc, add the following...</p>

<p>``` bash Allow to search inside Perl @INC and find installed modules. Note that it can one argument
function plister () {
  # Get the current position to go back into it  after the script run
  INITIAL_POSITION=$(PWD)
  PLISTER_HOME=$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5/App/Module/
  # Have to move because of limitation of the module
  # See http://search.cpan.org/dist/App-Module-Lister/lib/App/Module/Lister.pm#TO_DO
  cd ${PLISTER_HOME}</p>

<p>  # Search with a pattern
  if [ $1 ] ; then</p>

<pre><code># \grep "unalias" grep if you got some
  perl Lister.pm | \grep --ignore-case $1
  echo "Searched with App::Module::Lister with pattern $1"
</code></pre>

<p>  # Search all modules installed
  else</p>

<pre><code>  perl Lister.pm
  echo "Searched with App::Module::Lister with no pattern"
</code></pre>

<p>  fi
  cd ${INITIAL_POSITION}
}
```</p>

<p><code>source</code> your <code>.bashrc</code>, and you now got a nice modules <em>local search-engine</em> based on <code>App::Module::Lister</code> abilities.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ plister Module::Starter
Module::Starter 1.60
Module::Starter::Smart  0.0.4
Module::Starter::Simple 1.60
Module::Starter::App    1.60
Module::Starter::BuilderSet 1.60
Module::Starter::Plugin::Template   1.60
Searched with App::Module::Lister with pattern Module::Starter
