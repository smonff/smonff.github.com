<p>I still try to use Firefox because it is a great Free Software and I like it. But sometimes, it become damn slow, and the temptation to use Chrome is high, because it is so speed !</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve tryed many things :</p>

<ul>
<li>reducing number of opened tabs, using <a href="http://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a> to close tabs more easily</li>
<li>disable extensions, and enable it only when needed</li>
<li>try strange tricks from people that seem to understand something from the <code>about:config</code> mess</li>
</ul>
